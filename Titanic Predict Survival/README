KAGGLE Clasification Problem

Data Preprocessing

Read test and train csv file using panda. The Survived column, which is the set of labels is dropped.

The columns having NaN values were found out and filled with the most frequent value.

2.Feature Engineering

Creation of new features by checking the correlation with Survived variable

Columns which had non-numeric value were encoded into numeric value. This process is called Encoding of categorical variables.

3.Normalization of data

Normalization of data using log(1+x).
Then after all above steps, the data spilt again into train & test set.


Here I used PCA with 1 regression model SVR .
Firstly, I predict the results using SVR.

Result:
80.861 accuracy
