1. Data Preprocessing

1.	Read test and train csv file using panda. The SalesPrice column, which is the set of labels or true prices is dropped.


2.	The columns having NaN values were found out and filled with the most frequent value. In case of columns having NaNs as most frequent value, missing values were imputed by ‘None’.


2.Feature Engineering

1.	The columns which are highly correlated with sale price are generated by polynomial degree 2 & 3 

2.	Columns which had non-numeric value were encoded into numeric value. This process is called Encoding of categorical variables.


3.Normalization of data

1.	Normalization of data using log(1+x).
2.	Then after all above steps, the data  spilt again into train & test set.


4.performing Regression

1. Here I used 2 regression model XGBOOST & LASSO.
2. Firstly, I predict the results using XGBOOST and then with lasso, In the end, I clubbed the predicted result with this piece of code (y_pred*0.5 +y_pred_lasso )/1.5

	
	 	


Observation:  
1.	Instead of dropping column contains NaN’s if I replaced then with None I can score better.
2.	If I filled Columns contain NaN’s with  most Frequent Value can also increase my score.
3.	I  was Trying Random forest & SVR but with XGBOOST and lasso results were far better.
