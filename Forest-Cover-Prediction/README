# What is this?

Forest cover prediction using ML technique

#Algo used:

1) RANDOM FOREST
2) SVM

#Install Dependency:

1) numpy -- pip3 install numpy
2) scipy -- pip3 install scipy
3) scikit-learn --- pip3 install scikit-learn



# Observation

Random Forests perform better than the SVM classfier both in terms of predictions and computational time.


# Result

Accuracy of Random Forests: 83.45 % Accuracy of SVM: 76.93 %
